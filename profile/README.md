## What is ValidStudy?

ValidStudy is an organization that produces useful opensource projects to help you study better and more efficiently.

We create desktop applications and write passages about ways to improve study performance.  
Since they are open source projects, they are free to use.If you have any questions, you can refer to the license in the repository.

(*The passages will be written in Chinese, if you are interested in translating them to English or other languages, please create a pull request in the repository.*)
